## About the Game
Glasshaven is a psychological mystery and horror game. The world of Glasshaven functions by strange rules; the Gods are feared rather 
than revered, citizens worship an immortal prince who lives in a barren castle, and parents die when their children no longer need them. 
Over the course of the game, the player explores the world of Glasshaven and learns its secrets. Which characters the player unlocks–and 
what happens to those characters–depends on the player’s choices.  

The demo includes three playable chapters: the prelude, Chapter 1, and Chapter 2.  

<i>Content warnings for death, violence, and suicide ideation. This game also includes brief flashes.</i>

<b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b>  
<b>I made this demo as a project for my first-ever programming class. As such, the code has a lot of bugs.
