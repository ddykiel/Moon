> You can’t choose your past, but you choose how to remember it. In Monstrous, you face memories of your worst traits. 
How you reflect on them will determine who you become in the next chapter of your life. At the end of the game, you
receive one of four monstrous forms.
Your past has made you into a monster—but what kind of monster will it be?

The game is available for free download [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/t3fi9m3suzeues8/Monstrous.zip?dl=0)

## Download Instructions
* Click “Continue to view” to not log into Dropbox
* In the upper right-hand corner of the screen, click on “Download,” then click on “Direct Download”
* Download zipped folder (not the individual files)
* Extract files in zipped folder
* Inside the now-extracted folder, click on “Monstrous.exe” to open  

The game is a .exe file, so it only runs on Windows computers, unless you have a workaround for Macs 
(such as WINE or a virtual environment). Unfortunately, this is a limitation of the PyGame library I used to make the game.

The code for the game is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ddykiel/Monstrous).

I also made a video tutorial on how to use Monstrous' code as a template for your own text-based games
