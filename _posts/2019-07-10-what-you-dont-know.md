I want to tell you that the subway map //
Looks like a disembodied heart, with colored lines //
Spilling blood from broken vessels. You should know //
The fog from the city has not left since this morning, //
And by now it must have sunk deep enough //
To become a part of me; I am not the only one //
Who has seen the cold mist beneath their skin, //
Reflected over walls of rolling brick. An image, //
Disconnected from everyone and everything. //

I am among those who wonder //
If love is salvation or self-destruction: //
If it takes more bravery to say “I love you” //
or “I’m leaving you”, and if either //
Is tantamount to suicide. //

<span style="color: white">blankspaceblankspace</span>Darling, this story has been told too many times //

And they had to cut the locks from the couple’s bridge in Paris //
Because the weight was too heavy to bear; we know better //
Than to hope for forever. We have traded our locks //
For copper coins, and cast them in the river below.//
We wait for a splash of water and not a clang//
Of discordant metal from those who came before, yet//
I still hear the reverberations of their oaths//
As I ride this empty subway car. A part of me//
Cannot help but believe this story will end the same way//

<span style="color: white">blankspaceblankspace</span>Even if it is you and I who tell it.
