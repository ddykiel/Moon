*XVIII: an exploration* is a collection of four interactive digital pieces, based around the Moon Tarot Card. XVIII is my undergraduate honors thesis, created in pursuit of a combined Computer Science and Creative Writing degree at New College of Florida.

*XVIII* includes a lyric essay in the form  of a scrolling story, a text-based video game, a fictional audio-visual journal, and an interactive text piece utilizing random chance. 

You can experience XVIII [here](https://ddykiel.github.io/xviii/).
