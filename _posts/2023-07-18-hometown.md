<pre>
And if I could compel you
into existence, you would move
like a cloud across the sky
	<i>(light from below
		but heavy from
	above)</i>
The shadow of the plane bears a scar
on your skin, and you move so slow against the roar
of the engines, as if you know
I am waiting for you to disappear, and reticent,
you pull back the days of my childhood.

How swiftly you once scuttled
across the sky, your white form 
sliding between my fingertips like time:
	<i>(11, 12, 13
		Growing up, growing up, 
almost grown up
		but never
		quite)</i>

I am now old enough
to speak of Home as a lover, whose presence
is tender yet leaden weight.
I am young enough to have never
known anyone else, a pleasure that almost
feels like pain-
	<i>(where did you
		grow up?	
	did you have a happy
		childhood?
	how to ever answer
		a question like that?)</i>

Then I wonder how I can put so many thoughts
into one vessel, how I can crush so many moments
<i>(the ones you gave
		from your cold soft heart, 
	which condense against my skin
		until they rain, and freeze, and thunder)</i>
into one feeling.
Yet first loves are always selfish,
and when I watch you leave
I think of only something
	like relief.
