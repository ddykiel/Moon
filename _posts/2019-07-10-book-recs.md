<h2><center>Book Recommendations</center></h2>
<center><i>Books that stirred my soul, for better or for worse</i></center>
      
<b><i>Giovanni’s Room</i> by James Baldwin</b>  
The emotions in this novel are perfectly pitched, as the powerful language conveys vulnerability, love, and repulsion. The story follows an American in Paris who falls for an Italian bartender; the characters are intensely described and evoke a strong reader response. Read it for a poignant portrait of the LGBT scene in Paris in the 1950s, as well as a heart-wrenching commentary on the nature of love and tragedy.  
  
<b><i>The Sense of an Ending</i> by Julian Barnes</b>  
Following a middle-aged man reflecting on his youth, this story is more than meets the eye. As the layered mystery unfolds, centering on the unreliability of memory and the question ‘What does it mean to live a fulfilling life?’, this novel is both an enjoyable and effective read.  

<b><i>Invisible Cities</i> by Italo Calvino</b>  
In this novel, each chapter describes a different city, as Marco Polo recounts his travels to the emperor Kublai Khan. Each vignette has its own unique theme and aesthetic; all together, this novel is an atmospheric and wondrous collection, reflecting both on human nature and the world we live in.  

<b><i>Waiting for the Barbarians</i> by J.M. Coetzee</b>  
Told from the point of view of a magistrate in Africa, this novel dissects theme of colonialism and entitlement. Coetzee’s writing is powerful, disturbing, and deeply psychological; he uses his mastery of craft to realize unusual character dynamics and poignant cultural commentary.  
  
<b><i>The Chocolate War</i> by Robert Cormier</b>  
This novel is a concise, striking read, focused on examining the psychology behind gang violence at an all-boy’s high school. Read this book for an unflinching portrayal of the cruelty, as well as the strength, existing in all of us.  

<b><i>No Longer Human</i> by Osamu Dazai</b>  
Dazai crafts a disconcerting character study of a man who feels as if he has been disqualified from being human. Dealing with apathy, self-destruction, and perceived monstrosity, this novel strikingly examines the nature of society and an individual’s role in it.  

<b><i>Steppenwolf</i> by Hermann Hesse</b>  
While indeed about a “sickness of the soul,” Steppenwolf is also about healing that sickness. It examines a fragmented self, which slowly and earnestly becomes closer to whole. Combined with glamorous settings and psychologically-stepped symbolism, Steppenwolf makes for a compelling read.  

<b><i>The God of Small Things</i> by Arundhati Roy</b>  
Painstakingly crafted, this novel follows a pair of identical twins as they grow up in India in the 1970s. The imagery-heavy and rhythmic writing conveys life in all its richness; this novel is an emotional odyssey that will both ruin and re-create you.  

<b><i>Pedro Páramo</i> by Juan Rulfo</b>  
Through stunning, hypnotic descriptions, Juan Rulfo crafts a mind-bending story about humanity’s relationship with death. As the memories of those who died echo across life, their pasts become living, breathing experiences.  

<b><i>Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe</i> by Benjamin Alire Sáenz</b>  
With simple, breathtaking prose, Sáenz delivers the story of two Mexican-American boys growing up in the late 1980s. It deals with the nuance of relationships between parents, friends, and lovers. This story drew me in and didn’t let me go.  

<b><i>Perfume: The Story of a Murderer</i> by Patrick Süskind</b>  
Sensual, violent, and descriptive, this novel paints a gut-wrenching portrait of life in 18th century Paris. It follows Grenouille, a serial killer obsessed with scent, and also serves as a commentary on what it means to be an artist. Read it for its sickening atmosphere and fascinating anti-hero main character.  

<h2><center>Honorable Mentions</center></h2>
<center><i>Books that were satisfyingly crafted</i></center>

<b><i>Cat’s Eye</i> by Margaret Atwood</b>  
In an atmospheric blend of bitterness and nostalgia, this story follows a painter who returns to her childhood home. Atwood’s characters are flawed and human, with a focus on their development.  

<b><i>The Fall</i> by Albert Camus</b>  
Surreal, poignant, and combative, this novel addresses hypocrisy and the narratives we tell ourselves to cope with our flaws. The structure of the novel, as a monologue spoken directly to the reader, deeply immerses the reader in the story.

<b><i>Ender’s Game</i> by Orson Scott Card</b>  
This novel follows a child prodigy named Ender, who is chosen by a government organization to wage war against aliens. This novel’s young characters are treated with respect and nuance, making them feel fully realized. Perfectly blending genre and literary themes, this novel examines the nature of love, war, and empathy.  

<b><i>The Virgin Suicides</i> by Jeff Eugenides</b>  
This novel tells the story of a group of sisters who commit suicide from the point of view of outsiders as they struggle to understand the tragedy. Taut with longing and romanticism, this novel’s perfect pacing and careful word choice makes it a deeply satisfying read.  

<b><i>The Ocean at the End of the Lane</i> by Neil Gaiman</b>  
A man in his thirties revisits his childhood home, remembering previously-forgotten events that happened to him at age seven. Through a sense of horror and wonder, this novel envelops you into a story about the vulnerability of childhood.  

<b><i>The Magicians</i> by Lev Grossman</b>  
Focusing on a group of narcissistic, neurotic college students, this novel examines the question of “What if magic was real?” Both as a critique and homage to the fantasy genre, this nihilistic and satirical novel packs a powerful punch.  

<b><i>Never Let Me Go</i> by Kazuo Ishiguro</b>  
Tender, emotional, and nostalgic, this science-fiction book is far more devastating than it initially may appear. Through thoughtful characterization, Ishiguro illustrates the importance of small and large moments alike.  

<b><i>We Have Always Lived in the Castle</i> by Shirley Jackson</b>  
Told with a chilling blend of childishness and cruelty, this novel focuses on isolation and insanity. The reader quickly becomes engrossed as they learn more about the characters and their perspectives as the story’s mysteries unfold.  

<b><i>The First Bad Man</i> by Miranda July</b>  
July’s main character functions with an idiosyncratic system, making for a fascinating read about the nature of romantic and maternal love. Clear, distinct, and emotional without being sentimental.  

<b><i>Let the Right One In</i> by John Ajvide Lindqvist</b>  
This horror novel is atmospheric and disturbing, as people are mysteriously murdered in a Swedish suburb in the 1980s. It follows a young boy named Oskar, whose arc deals poignantly with relationships and loneliness. There is also a large cast of supporting characters, each with their own unique neuroses.  

<b><i>The Woman Upstairs</i> by Claire Messud</b>  
The main character, Nora, is a middle-aged woman, bitter about the supporting role she plays in others’ lives. She becomes enraptured by the Shahid family, particularly Sirena Shahid, a successful artist. This character and theme focused novel candidly reveals life’s cruelties while also delving into themes of artistry and ambition.  

<b><i>Jazz</i> by Toni Morrison</b>  
Richly and empathetically written, this novel focuses on the murder of an 18-year-old girl by her spurred, middle-aged lover. It's also a story of Harlem in the 1920s, the soul of jazz music, the emotional intensity of romantic love, and an enigmatic narrator.    

<b><i>The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle</i> by Haruki Murakami</b>  
This novel reveals the absurdity of everyday life, as recently-unemployed Toru Okada’s life begins to unravel after the disappearance of his cat. Read it for a fascinating study of the subconscious, wherein logic is surreal, emotionally-driven, and steeped in symbolism.  

<b><i>Prize Stock (novella)</i> by Kenzaburō Ōe</b> 
A Japanese village captures an African-American fighter pilot during WWII, and a young boy chronicles the pilot's relationship with the village. Ōe's imaginative imagery, interwoven with themes of race, sexuality, and violence, makes this novella tangibly disturbing. (You might have an easier time finding it as <i>Teach Us To Outgrow Our Madness: 4 Short Novels</i>) 

<b><i>Atlas Shrugged</i> by Ayn Rand</b>  
Sharp, confident, and refreshingly uncynical, Rand's novel rejects literary precedent, focusing less on character and theme in preference for undiluted ideas. This novel is an experience, and much insight and exuberance can be gleaned from it. However, it must be taken with a massive grain of salt, as Rand's ideas are sometimes unempathetic and lacking in nuance.  

<b><i>Slaughterhouse-five</i> by Kurt Vonnegut</b>  
Vonnegut’s unique brand of dark humor makes this work a compact and striking piece. The cutting satire of this book manages to be funny while revealing the absurdity of war.  


<h2><center>Repeat Authors</center></h2>
<i><center>I try to only have one book per author on this post, but here are some exceptions.</center></i>  

<b><i>If on a Winter’s Night a Traveler</i> by Italo Calvino</b>  
A love letter to reading, this novel will take you on an adventure spanning numerous stories. Calvino’s writing is something to behold, as he skillfully showcases numerous styles and creates a hypnotic atmosphere.  

<i>Age of Iron</i> by J.M. Coetzee  
An aging classics professor writes a letter to her daughter as she dies of cancer. Coetzee illustrates Cape Town, South Africa through an honest and vivid lens, facing both the rage of the past and hopelessness of the future.  

<b><i>The Bluest Eye</i> by Toni Morrison</b>  
Through vivid, stylized writing, Morrison structures this story around the trauma of Pecola, a young, African-American girl. It deals with themes of race, interpersonal violence, beauty, and---at its cruelest and ugliest---love.   

<b><i>Sputnik Sweetheart</i> by Haruki Murakami</b>  
This novel focuses on a man known only as K, who suffers unrequited love for his best friend, Sumire. This short, character-focused novel features Murakami’s distinctly surreal style, wherein the subconscious has a tangible impact on reality. The writing is clear and moving, with a focus on what we can, and can’t, gain from relationships.  

<h2><center>Notes</center></h2>

This list is ordered alphabetically by author and updated periodically, about every six months.  

Some books on the “Honorable Mentions” list might get bumped up to my “Favorites” once I re-read them. The main difference between an “Honorable Mention” and “Favorite” is that my “Favorites” tend to have a strong emotional connection and influence on my life, though the line is sometimes blurred.  

I’m always looking for new recommendations, so if there’s a book you think I might like, feel free to [contact me!](https://ddykiel.github.io/reach-out/)
