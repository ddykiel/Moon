<h2><center>Book Recommendations</center></h2>
<center><i>Books that stirred my soul, for better or for worse</i></center>
<br>     
<b><i>Cat’s Eye</i> by Margaret Atwood</b>  
In an atmospheric blend of bitterness and nostalgia, this story follows a painter who returns to her childhood home. Atwood’s characters are flawed and human, with a focus on their development.  
<br>
<b><i>Giovanni’s Room</i> by James Baldwin</b>  
The emotions in this novel are perfectly pitched, as the powerful language conveys vulnerability, love, and repulsion. The story follows an American in Paris who falls for an Italian bartender; the characters are intensely described and evoke a strong reader response. Read it for a poignant portrait of the LGBT scene in Paris in the 1950s, as well as a heart-wrenching commentary on the nature of love and tragedy.  
<br>
<b><i>The Sense of an Ending</i> by Julian Barnes</b>  
Following a middle-aged man reflecting on his youth, this story is more than meets the eye. As the layered mystery unfolds, centering on the unreliability of memory and the question ‘What does it mean to live a fulfilling life?’, this novel is both an enjoyable and effective read.  
<br>
<b><i>Invisible Cities</i> by Italo Calvino</b>  
In this novel, each chapter describes a different city, as Marco Polo recounts his travels to the emperor Kublai Khan. Each vignette has its own unique theme and aesthetic; all together, this novel is an atmospheric and wondrous collection, reflecting both on human nature and the world we live in.  
<br>
<b><i>The Fall</i> by Albert Camus</b>  
Surreal, poignant, and combative, this novel addresses hypocrisy and the narratives we tell ourselves to cope with our flaws. The structure of the novel, as a monologue spoken directly to the reader, deeply immerses the reader in the story.  
<br>
<b><i>Waiting for the Barbarians</i> by J.M. Coetzee</b>  
Told from the point of view of a magistrate in Africa, this novel dissects theme of colonialism and entitlement. Coetzee’s writing is powerful, disturbing, and deeply psychological; he uses his mastery of craft to realize unusual character dynamics and poignant cultural commentary.  
<br>
<b><i>Ender’s Game</i> by Orson Scott Card</b>  
This novel follows a child prodigy named Ender, who is chosen by a government organization to wage war against aliens. This novel’s young characters are treated with respect and nuance, making them fully realized. Perfectly blending genre and literary themes, this novel examines the nature of love, war, and empathy.  
<br>
<b><i>Steppenwolf</i> by Hermann Hesse</b>  
While indeed about a “sickness of the soul,” Steppenwolf is also about healing that sickness. It examines a fragmented self, which slowly and earnestly becomes closer to whole. Combined with glamorous settings and psychologically-stepped symbolism, <i>Steppenwolf</i> makes for a compelling read.  
<br>
<b><i>Never Let Me Go</i> by Kazuo Ishiguro</b>  
Tender, emotional, and nostalgic, this science-fiction book is far more devastating than it initially may appear. Through thoughtful characterization, Ishiguro illustrates the importance of small and large moments alike.  
<br>
<b><i>The First Bad Man</i> by Miranda July</b>  
July’s main character functions with an idiosyncratic system, making for a fascinating read about the nature of romantic and maternal love. Clear, distinct, and emotional without being sentimental.  
<br>
<b><i>Jazz</i> by Toni Morrison</b>  
Richly and empathetically written, this novel focuses on the murder of an 18-year-old girl by her spurred, middle-aged lover. It's also a story of Harlem in the 1920s, the soul of jazz music, the emotional intensity of romantic love, and an enigmatic narrator.    
<br>
<b><i>The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle</i> by Haruki Murakami</b>  
This novel reveals the absurdity of everyday life, as recently-unemployed Toru Okada’s life begins to unravel after the disappearance of his cat. Read it for a fascinating study of the subconscious, wherein logic is surreal, emotionally-driven, and steeped in symbolism.  
<br>
<b><i>Prize Stock (novella)</i> by Kenzaburō Ōe</b>  
A Japanese village captures an African-American fighter pilot during WWII, and a young boy chronicles the pilot's relationship with the village. Ōe's imaginative imagery, interwoven with themes of race, sexuality, and violence, makes this novella tangibly disturbing. (You might have an easier time finding it as <i>Teach Us To Outgrow Our Madness: 4 Short Novels</i>)  
<br>
<b><i>The God of Small Things</i> by Arundhati Roy</b>  
Painstakingly crafted, this novel follows a pair of identical twins as they grow up in India in the 1970s. The imagery-heavy and rhythmic writing conveys life in all its richness; this novel is an emotional odyssey that will both ruin and re-create you.  
<br>
<b><i>Pedro Páramo</i> by Juan Rulfo</b>  
Through stunning, hypnotic descriptions, Juan Rulfo crafts a mind-bending story about humanity’s relationship with death. As the memories of those who died echo across life, their pasts become living, breathing experiences.  
<br>
<b><i>Slaughterhouse-five</i> by Kurt Vonnegut</b>  
Vonnegut’s unique brand of dark humor makes this work a compact and striking piece. The cutting satire of this book manages to be funny while revealing the absurdity of war.  
<br>
<b><i>Dialogues in Paradise</i> by Can Xue</b>  
Glittering, evocative, and uncanny, these avant-guard short stories eschew traditional narrative constructs to strike a deep, emotional chord.
