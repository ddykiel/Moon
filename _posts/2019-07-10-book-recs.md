<center> ## Book Recommendations </center>
<center><i>Books that stirred my soul, for better or for worse</i></center>

      
<b><i>Giovanni’s Room</i> by James Baldwin</b>  
The emotions in this novel are perfectly pitched, as the powerful language conveys vulnerability, love, and repulsion. The story follows an American in Paris who falls for an Italian bartender; the characters are intensely described and evoke a strong reader response. Read it for a poignant portrait of the LGBT scene in Paris in the 1950s, as well as a heart-wrenching commentary on the nature of love and tragedy.  
  
<b><i>The Sense of an Ending</i> by Julian Barnes</b>  
Following a middle-aged man reflecting on his youth, this story is more than meets the eye. As the layered mystery unfolds, centering on the unreliability of memory and the question ‘What does it mean to live a fulfilling life?’, this novel is both an enjoyable and effective read.  
  
<b><i>If on a Winter’s Night a Traveler</i> by Italo Calvino</b>  
A love letter to reading, this novel will take you on an adventure spanning numerous stories. Calvino’s writing is something to behold, as he skillfully showcases numerous styles and creates a hypnotic atmosphere.  
  
<i>Waiting for the Barbarians</i> by J.M. Coetzee

<i>The Chocolate War</i> by Robert Cormier  
This novel is a concise, striking read, focused on examining the psychology behind gang violence at an all-boy’s high school. Read this book for an unflinching portrayal of the cruelty, as well as the strength, existing in all of us.  

<i>No Longer Human</i> by Osamu Dazai  
Dazai crafts a disconcerting character study of a man who feels as if he has been disqualified from being human. Dealing with apathy, self-destruction, and perceived monstrosity, this novel strikingly examines the nature of society and an individual’s role in it.  

<i>Steppenwolf</i> by Hermann Hesse  
While indeed about a “sickness of the soul,” Steppenwolf is also about healing that sickness. It examines a fragmented self, which slowly and earnestly becomes closer to whole. Combined with glamorous settings and psychologically-stepped symbolism, Steppenwolf makes for a compelling read.  

<i>The God of Small Things</i> by Arundhati Roy  
Painstakingly crafted, this novel follows a pair of identical twins as they grow up in India in the 1970s. The imagery-heavy and rhythmic writing conveys life in all its richness; this novel is an emotional odyssey that will both ruin and re-create you.  

<i>Pedro Páramo</i> by Juan Rulfo  
Through stunning, hypnotic descriptions, Juan Rulfo crafts a mind-bending story about humanity’s relationship with death. As the memories of those who died echo across life, their pasts become living, breathing experiences.  

<i>Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe</i> by Benjamin Alire Sáenz  
With simple, breathtaking prose, Sáenz delivers the story of two Mexican-American boys growing up in the late 1980s. It deals with the nuance of relationships between parents, friends, and lovers. This story drew me in and didn’t let me go.  

<i>Perfume: The Story of a Murderer</i> by Patrick Süskind  
Sensual, violent, and descriptive, this novel paints a gut-wrenching portrait of life in 18th century Paris. It follows Grenouille, a serial killer obsessed with scent, and also serves as a commentary on what it means to be an artist. Read it for its sickening atmosphere and fascinating anti-hero main character.  

<i>Slaughterhouse-five</i> by Kurt Vonnegut  
Vonnegut’s unique brand of dark humor makes this work a compact and striking piece. The cutting satire of this book manages to be funny while revealing the absurdity of war.

July’s main character functions with an idiosyncratic system, making for a fascinating read about the nature of romantic and maternal love. Clear, distinct, and emotional without being sentimental.  

<i>Let the Right One In</i> by John Ajvide Lindqvist  
This horror novel is atmospheric and disturbing, as people are mysteriously murdered in a Swedish suburb in the 1980s. It follows a young boy named Oskar, whose arc deals poignantly with relationships and loneliness. There is also a large cast of supporting characters, each with their own unique neuroses.

<h2>Notes</h2>
</p>

This list is ordered alphabetically by author and updated periodically, about every six months.  

Some books on the “Honorable Mentions” list might get bumped up to my “Favorites” once I re-read them. The main difference between an “Honorable Mention” and “Favorite” is that my “Favorites” tend to have a strong emotional connection and influence on my life, though the line is sometimes blurred.  

I’m always looking for new recommendations, so if there’s a book you think I might like, feel free to [contact me!](https://ddykiel.github.io/reach-out/)
