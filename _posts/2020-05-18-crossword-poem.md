I created this website with three other students as part of my Software Enginnering class. We designed and implemented the website for Dr. Emily Carr, a professional poet.

This project was created with Angular JS and hosted on GitHub pages.

## Concept of the Website

The Crossword Poem is a form of poetry invented by Dr. Emily Carr. In our implementation, the user clicks clues that intruige them. The corresponding word shows on the crossword grid. The clue gets added to a unique user-generated poem, which the user can save or print.

We used Agile while creating this project. Each person chose tasks suited to their skills. I focused primarily on design, user-testing, and coding.

## Design of the Website

This project was initially meant to be displayed on a projector at the [Electronic Literature Organization Conference and Media Festival](https://elo.cah.ucf.edu/). When the conference was made remote due to Covid-19, we had to modify our design to fit on a single computer screen. I designed 11 mock-ups with different design considerations, such as the number of columns, color of buttons, position of scrollbars, etc. Below are three of the mockups I created.

I incorporated feedback from my teammates, my classmates, and Dr. Carr to create the final design. 

## Other Contributions

I contributed to background research, coding in HTML/CSS/JS/TypeScript using Angular, and documentation.

I conducted three user tests, which involved filming interactions, anonymizing data, and communicating results.
