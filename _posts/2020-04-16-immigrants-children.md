# Immigrants' Children  

We cast aside soggy vegetables for clear, cold cream.  
We cut our mouths on edges of plastic; we spit out  
the thin, ink-worn pages  
of your grandmother’s cookbook,  
which crumble with the taste 
of age and sickness, like the mothballs  
you are draped in  
as you shuffle in the attic, keeping lighted  
the dim stars of your history.  

We dance  
robed in folded rays of light, with  
jewels blooming over our skin   
in pus-filled beads of color;  
the jewelry we wear for beauty  
while we bear your native tongue like a choker.  
We love  
its certain je ne sais quoi.  
We are to blame  
for the crumbling clasp and cracks in the stone.  

The city calls us to smoke and flames.  
We watch with glowing eyes, seeing no darkness  
as expensive cars crash, then burst  
into fireworks.  
There we lick our fingers, our tongues  
rasping with iron and slick with oil.  
We wave our neon dollars, yelling “God bless America.”
