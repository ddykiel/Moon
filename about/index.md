Hi, Iâ€™m Daniel.

I'm a poet and prose writer with a technological background. I create in various styles, often incorporating multimedia, experimental, and interactive digital elements. 

I also have experience with technical documentation, publishing tools, and software development. I work remotely as an Associate Tools and Operations Specialist for Pegasystems. In 2022, I graduated from New College of Florida with a degree in Computer Science and Creative Writing. 

I've fallen in love with two cities: St. Petersburg FL, where I currently live, and Boston MA, near where I grew up. I have a deep interest in Tarot, symbols, and the subconscoius.
