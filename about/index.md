> Yet we will try to reach each other over this small round table. We will string out words like jewels and offer our sentences like necklaces in hopes the other will appreciate their worth; in hopes that we will share a small piece of our ambiguous truths. And that is enough.

Hi, Iâ€™m Daniel. 

I believe in applying principles of storytelling, creativity, and technology to all areas of my work. Much of what I do exists between disciplines. I have experience with technical documentation, video game writing, human-centered design, and interactive digital media.

I study Creative Writing and Computer Science at New College of Florida, in Sarasota. While not in Florida, I can be found in the greater Boston area.

Lately, I've been thinking about: fractals and fragmentation as a creative lens, how to best foreground compassion, and the collective subconscious.
