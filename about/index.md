> Yet we will try to reach each other over this small round table. We will string out words like jewels and offer our sentences like necklaces in hopes the other will appreciate their worth; in hopes that we will share a small piece of our ambiguous truths. And that is enough.

Hi, I’m Daniel. I like to create in many forms.

I’ve been writing creatively since elementary school, and editing since high school. I enjoy all forms of writing, but I’m particularly partial to poetry and novels.

In college, I discovered my interest in Computer Science. Combining this with my interest in English, I've done several projects involving text analysis and text-based video games. I'm most comfortable with Python, Java, and R.

I study at New College of Florida, in Sarasota. During breaks, I can be found in the greater Boston area.

## Contact

The best way to reach me is via email, dana.dykiel18@ncf.edu

Feel free to reach out for creative collaboration (editing, short films, etc), if you have feedback on any projects on this site, or if you would like to talk about common interests.

## Other interests

Meditation, consciousness, existentialism, drawing, hiking, running, French, Spanish
