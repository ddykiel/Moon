> Yet we will try to reach each other over this small round table. We will string out words like jewels and offer our sentences like necklaces in hopes the other will appreciate their worth; in hopes that we will share a small piece of our ambiguous truths. And that is enough.

Hi, I’m Daniel. I like to create in many forms.

I’ve been writing creatively since elementary school, and editing since high school. All forms of writing interest me, but I’m particularly partial to poetry and novels.

In college, I discovered my interest in Computer Science. Currently, my main areas of focus are the intersection between STEM/the humanities, the subconscious/consciousness, and themes of perception/ambiguity.

I study at New College of Florida, in Sarasota. During breaks, I can be found in the greater Boston area.

I love to meet new people and work on new projects, so please get in touch if you would like to collaborate.
