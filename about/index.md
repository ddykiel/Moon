Hi, I’m Daniel.

I write poetry, prose, and all the genres in between. I’m interested in the permeable membrane between the delightful and the grotesque. I write what thrills me, what unsettles me, what I can’t look away from. Often, this includes monstrosity, food, and poetry in response to film. My short pieces have appeared in various magazines.

Currently, I'm pursuing an MFA in Creative Writing at the University of South Florida. I instruct Form & Technique of Fiction Course with an original curriculm, as well as First-Year Composition. In teaching, I tailoring coursework to individual needs and creating engaging online courses. I edit fiction for <i>Saw Palm</i> magazine and work as an intern for the <a href="https://ddykiel.github.io/book-recs/">Short Story Today</a> podcast.

I formerly worked as an Associate Tools and Operations Specialist for Pegasystems. I have a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science and Creative Writing from New College of Florida.

<h3>Currently, I'm thinking about: labyrinths, center points, and doomed narratives</h3>
