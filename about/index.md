Hi, Iâ€™m Daniel.

I believe in applying principles of storytelling, creativity, and technology to all areas of my work. Much of what I do exists between disciplines. I have experience with technical documentation tools, interactive digitial media. and various forms of writing.

I work remotely as a Assocaite Tools and Operations Specialist for Pegasystems. Recently, I graduated New College of Florida with a degree in Computer Science and Creative Writing. I live in the sunny city of St. Petersburg, FL.

<h4>Lately, I've been thinking about: mirrors, masks, and labyrinths</h4>
