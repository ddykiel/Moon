Hi, Iâ€™m Daniel.

I'm a poet and prose writer with a technological background. My works often incorporate multimedia, experimental, and interactive digital elements. 

I also have experience with technical documentation, publishing tools, and software development. I work remotely as an Associate Tools and Operations Specialist for Pegasystems. In 2022, I graduated from New College of Florida with a degree in Computer Science and Creative Writing. 

I live in the sunny city of St. Petersburg, FL. My creative practice also includes Tarot, gardening, and cooking.
