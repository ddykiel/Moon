Hi, Iâ€™m Daniel.

I love poetry, prose, and all the genres in between. My work often focuses on monstrosities and the subconscious. Currently, I'm an M.F.A. student at the University of South Florida.

I also have experience with technical documentation, publishing tools, and interactive digital media. I formerly worked as an Associate Tools and Operations Specialist for Pegasystems. I have a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science and Creative Writing from New College of Florida.

I've fallen in love with two cities: St. Petersburg FL, where I currently live, and Boston MA, near where I grew up. I also have an interest in Tarot, symbols, and the subconscoius.

<b>Lately, I've been thinking about: labyrinths & repetition, crabs & other ocean insects, writing as play</b>
